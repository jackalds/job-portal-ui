**Where to look:**

- Adding a new page → `src/pages/` + register route in `App.jsx`
- Shared UI → `src/components/`
- Auth logic → `src/context/AuthContext.jsx`
- Job/application logic → `src/context/JobContext.jsx`
- Mock data changes → `src/data/mockData.js`
- API simulation → `src/services/`

## Git Conventions

### Branching

```
feature/add-job-filter-sidebar         # New features
fix/employer-route-redirect-loop       # Bug fixes
docs/update-readme                     # Documentation only
chore/upgrade-dependencies             # Maintenance, tooling
refactor/simplify-auth-context         # Code refactoring
style/mobile-job-card-spacing          # Visual/style changes
```

- Branch off `main` for all new work
- Keep branches short-lived; open a PR when ready
- Delete branches after merging

### Commit Messages

Follow **Conventional Commits**:

```
feat: add saved jobs count to navbar
fix: correct role guard on employer routes
docs: update README with localStorage keys
chore: upgrade react-router to v7.8
refactor: extract job card into reusable component
style: fix spacing on mobile job list
```

- Use present tense, lowercase, no period at the end
- Keep the subject line under 72 characters
- Add a body for non-obvious changes

### Pull Requests

- PR title should match the commit message format
- Include a summary and test plan in the PR description
- Target `main` as the base branch

## Coding Standards

### General

- **No TypeScript** — plain JSX throughout; do not add `.ts`/`.tsx` files
- **Functional components only** — no class components
- **Named exports** preferred over default exports for components
- Keep components focused — extract reusable pieces into `src/components/`

### Styling

- Use **Tailwind CSS utility classes** exclusively — no inline styles, no CSS modules
- Follow mobile-first responsive design (`sm:`, `md:`, `lg:` breakpoints)
- Dark mode via `ThemeContext` — use conditional class toggling, not `dark:` variants

### State & Data

- Use React Context for shared state — no external state library
- Do not fetch data directly in page components; use services in `src/services/`
- All async service calls must use `delay()` to simulate latency
- Persist user-specific data to localStorage using the established key pattern (`{entity}_{userId}`)

### Naming

- Components: `PascalCase` (e.g., `JobCard.jsx`)
- Variables/functions: `camelCase`
- Constants: `UPPER_SNAKE_CASE`
- Files: match the default export name (e.g., `JobCard.jsx` exports `JobCard`)

### ESLint

Flat config (`eslint.config.js`). The `no-unused-vars` rule ignores variables starting with uppercase or underscore (`varsIgnorePattern: '^[A-Z_]'`). Run `npm run lint` before committing.

## Architecture

React 19 SPA using Vite 7, Tailwind CSS 4, and React Router 7. No TypeScript — plain JSX throughout.

### State Management

Two layers of React Context:

- **`src/context/`** — Core contexts: `AuthContext` (auth + dummy users + localStorage persistence), `JobContext` (applications, saved jobs, employer job CRUD), `ThemeContext`
- **`src/contexts/`** — Data-fetching contexts: `JobsDataContext` (cached job list with 5-min TTL), `CompaniesContext`

Provider nesting order (in App.jsx): AuthProvider → JobsDataProvider → JobProvider → CompaniesProvider → ThemeProvider

### Data Layer

Currently uses **mock data** with localStorage persistence — no real backend. Services in `src/services/` simulate async API calls using `delay()` from `src/utils/delay.js`. Data originates from `src/data/mockData.js`.

Key localStorage keys: `jobPortalUser`, `authToken`, `registeredUsers`, `globalPostedJobs`, `jobApplications_{userId}`, `savedJobs_{userId}`, `postedJobs_{userId}`.

### Routing & Roles

Three roles with route protection via `ProtectedRoute` component:

- **ROLE_JOB_SEEKER** — profile, applied-jobs, saved-jobs
- **ROLE_EMPLOYER** — post-job, employer/jobs, job-applicants/:jobId
- **ROLE_ADMIN** — admin/\*, admin pages in `src/pages/admin/`

### Key Libraries

- Font Awesome + Lucide React for icons
- react-toastify for notifications

### ESLint

Flat config (`eslint.config.js`). The `no-unused-vars` rule ignores variables starting with uppercase or underscore (`varsIgnorePattern: '^[A-Z_]'`).

## 1. Think Before Coding

**Don't assume. Don't hide confusion. Surface tradeoffs.**

Before implementing:

- State your assumptions explicitly. If uncertain, ask.
- If multiple interpretations exist, present them - don't pick silently.
- If a simpler approach exists, say so. Push back when warranted.
- If something is unclear, stop. Name what's confusing. Ask.

## 2. Simplicity First

**Minimum code that solves the problem. Nothing speculative.**

- No features beyond what was asked.
- No abstractions for single-use code.
- No "flexibility" or "configurability" that wasn't requested.
- No error handling for impossible scenarios.
- If you write 200 lines and it could be 50, rewrite it.

Ask yourself: "Would a senior engineer say this is overcomplicated?" If yes, simplify.

## 3. Surgical Changes

**Touch only what you must. Clean up only your own mess.**

When editing existing code:

- Don't "improve" adjacent code, comments, or formatting.
- Don't refactor things that aren't broken.
- Match existing style, even if you'd do it differently.
- If you notice unrelated dead code, mention it - don't delete it.

When your changes create orphans:

- Remove imports/variables/functions that YOUR changes made unused.
- Don't remove pre-existing dead code unless asked.

The test: Every changed line should trace directly to the user's request.

## 4. Goal-Driven Execution

**Define success criteria. Loop until verified.**

Transform tasks into verifiable goals:

- "Add validation" → "Write tests for invalid inputs, then make them pass"
- "Fix the bug" → "Write a test that reproduces it, then make it pass"
- "Refactor X" → "Ensure tests pass before and after"

For multi-step tasks, state a brief plan:

```
1. [Step] → verify: [check]
2. [Step] → verify: [check]
3. [Step] → verify: [check]
```

Strong success criteria let you loop independently. Weak criteria ("make it work") require constant clarification.

---

**These guidelines are working if:** fewer unnecessary changes in diffs, fewer rewrites due to overcomplication, and clarifying questions come before implementation rather than after mistakes.
